# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

This data set has data of customers of a financial institution. This data set is used for a marketing campaign to identify and target customers who are likely to to start a deposit account or a term deposit account. The data set is used to predict and identify these customers and using this prediction the marketing campaign would target these customers with new deposit term accounts.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

AutoML provided the best model. The XGBoost Classifier with Standard Scaling was the best performing model with an accuracy of 0.9154.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

The pipeline architecture includes 
  - Data Preparation

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
